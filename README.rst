Abstract
========
The primary goal of this research is to develop methods for the correct integration of new concepts into the embedding space of text-to-image generative models to enhance the quality of output images. By achieving this, the research seeks to enable controlled modification of concepts, ensuring that the semantics of personalized phrases remain closely aligned with their corresponding category-centered words. This alignment is critical for preserving the compositional and semantic integrity of the generated images.

The research aims to learn effective text embeddings for new concepts that not only accurately represent the concepts but also seamlessly integrate with existing tokens in the model's language-vision dictionary. The enhanced dictionary would bind newly introduced words with specific user-defined subjects, enabling the model to synthesize novel, photorealistic images of these subjects in diverse contexts while maintaining their key identifying features. Ultimately, the research strives to expand the capabilities of generative models, allowing for precise personalization and editing without compromising image quality or semantic coherence.
